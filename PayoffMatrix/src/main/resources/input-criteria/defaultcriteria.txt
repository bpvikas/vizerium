# The volatility of the underlying. Used to calculate the range of the underlying.
# This can be either the implied volatility (e.g. India VIX for the Index) or the historical volatility
# For implied volatility, just populate India VIX in the variable "underlying.volatility.standardDeviation". The other values 
# underlying.volatility.mean will be calculated from the historical data.
# If none of the values are provided, then the historical volatility auto-calculated from the 8.5 years closing prices of the underlying will be used.
# The range calculation here will also take into consideration the time to expiry either from contract.duration/contract.series or from expiryDate
#Possible values for standardDeviationMultiple are 1, 2, 3, for 1st, 2nd and 3rd standard deviation.
